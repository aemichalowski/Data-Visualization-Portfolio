Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the differences in amount of time on social media between different groups over time (2014->2018)_

Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 


_There has been an upward trend in social media in general, but younger generations spend more time on social media._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_No, this is pretty standard. I would like to maybe see a breakdown by smaller time spans like months if it were available. Maybe you could add age ranges for the generations._

Is there anything you would do differently?

_You could add different marker types for the generations. I don't think you need Year on the x-axis either since the labels already make it clear what you're talking about._

_A graph about how much people use social media._

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_As time progresses, use of social media has been increasing and young people use it a lot more._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_Not really._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I don't think so._

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the percent of each generation that uses different social media platforms_

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_In general, the younger generations have a higher percent of using all forms of social media, though Youtube and Facebook have fairly high overall use among all generations._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_It is interesting how big the disparity between age groups is for Twitter and Instagram._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_Maybe use subplots, but it also looks good like this_

**User 2**

Can you tell me what you think this is? 

_A graph of what kind of social media people use_

Can you describe what this is telling you?

_The percent of each generation who use different apps or social media sites._

Is there anything surprising or confusing?

_Which people use the apps? Is it population percents or the percent of time being used? The y-axis isn't clear._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I like when the percent is shown on or above the bars because it can be hard to read the axis when there are so many bars._
