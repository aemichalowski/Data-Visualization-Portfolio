Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the differences in amount of time on social media between different groups over time (2014->2018)_

Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 


_There has been an upward trend in social media in general, but younger generations spend more time on social media._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_No, this is pretty standard. I would like to maybe see a breakdown by smaller time spans like months if it were available. Maybe you could add age ranges for the generations._

Is there anything you would do differently?

_You could add different marker types for the generations. I don't think you need Year on the x-axis either since the labels already make it clear what you're talking about._

Can you tell me what you think this is?


_A graph about how much people use social media._

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_As time progresses, use of social media has been increasing and young people use it a lot more._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_Not really._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I don't think so._

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the percent of each generation that uses different social media platforms_

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_In general, the younger generations have a higher percent of using all forms of social media, though Youtube and Facebook have fairly high overall use among all generations._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_It is interesting how big the disparity between age groups is for Twitter and Instagram._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_Maybe use subplots, but it also looks good like this_

**User 2**

Can you tell me what you think this is? 

_A graph of what kind of social media people use_

Can you describe what this is telling you?

_The percent of each generation who use different apps or social media sites._

Is there anything surprising or confusing?

_Which people use the apps? Is it population percents or the percent of time being used? The y-axis isn't clear._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I like when the percent is shown on or above the bars because it can be hard to read the axis when there are so many bars._

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the average social media accounts by generation and region._

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_Younger generations have more accounts than older generations. People in Latin America and Asia have more accounts than people in other regions._

Is there anything you find surpsising or confusing?

_I think the size of the dot is not a super clear representation of the number. I think these kinds of charts work better if there are bigger differences in the numbers and sizes. With the colors and the axes, it is difficult to focus on the regions because my eye is drawn to the colored generations. It is just a little overwhelming._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I wouldn't use different colors for different generations. Maybe use a heatmap on a table or something else. I just don't think the dot size thing is working._

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_A plot of social media accounts for different regions and generations_

Can you describe what this is telling you?

_Not really.It is pretty confusing._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_Assuming the number is the number of separate social media accounts a single person has, I think, some of these groups have way more accounts than I would have expected._

Is there anything you would change of do differently?

_I want it to tell me what its trying to say. Speak your truth chart. But in all seriousness, I think it just needs a different design. There's too much going on here for me to figure out what  you're trying to tell me._
