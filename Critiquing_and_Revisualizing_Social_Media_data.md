Can you tell me what you think this is?

The plot shows the differences in amount of time on social media between different groups over time (2014->2018)

Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 

There has been an upward trend in social media in general, but younger generations spend more time on social media.

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

No, this is pretty standard. I would like to maybe see a breakdown by smaller time spans like months if it were available. Maybe you could add age ranges for the generations.

Is there anything you would do differently?

You could add different marker types for the generations.

A graph about how much people use social media.

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

As time progresses, use of social media has been increasing and young people use it a lot more.

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

Not really.

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

I don't think so.
