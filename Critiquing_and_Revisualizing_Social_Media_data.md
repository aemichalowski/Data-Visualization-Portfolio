### What Makes this Visualization Interesting
Throughout this project, I will revisualize data on social media trends among generations originally presented by GWI as seen above. The infographic details generational trends in social media use and is intended for a marketing audience who wants to understand how to reach particular segments of its target audience. I chose this infographic because it was very eye-catching and aesthetically pleasing, but upon closer inspection did not clearly convey the data. The data characterizes each of the target segments by their social media use and even explores trends across regions for global marketers, but in its current form, it is difficult to make accurate comparisons between groups because the styles of charts used do not suit the data. Thus, I decided I would explore this data and revisualize it, so that this useful information could be more clearly communicated to the target audience and show the impact of design choices on the meaning of data. 

### Critiquing the Initial Graphic

The original infographic is very aesthetically pleasing. The bright colors are attention getting and modern in a way that suits data about social media. Additionally, the graphics are very clean and organized. Given the strength of the color scheme, I maintained the colors throughout my own desings. However, the types of charts used make the data difficult to interpret. According to the narrative from the article the infographic was in, the stacked area chart is meant to demonstrate trends in social media use over time, with an emphasis on the slope of the change. However, this slope is distorted when the areas are stacked on top of one another and subject to the slope of the other categories. The authors attempted to show the changing slope through call out bubbles detailing the year-to-year change in time on social media, but these call-outs were difficult to interpret, so the main point of interest was still not clearly conveyed on the chart. For the circle chart, it was difficult to compare the sizes of the circles between countries because they were not aligned with one another. This makes it difficult to see how generational trends differ between countries, which means the main finding of the data is not clearly represented by this style of visualization.

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the differences in amount of time on social media between different groups over time (2014->2018)_

Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 


_There has been an upward trend in social media in general, but younger generations spend more time on social media._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_No, this is pretty standard. I would like to maybe see a breakdown by smaller time spans like months if it were available. Maybe you could add age ranges for the generations._

Is there anything you would do differently?

_You could add different marker types for the generations. I don't think you need Year on the x-axis either since the labels already make it clear what you're talking about._

Can you tell me what you think this is?


_A graph about how much people use social media._

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_As time progresses, use of social media has been increasing and young people use it a lot more._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_Not really._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I don't think so._

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_The plot shows the average social media accounts by generation and region._

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_Younger generations have more accounts than older generations. People in Latin America and Asia have more accounts than people in other regions._

Is there anything you find surpsising or confusing?

_I think the size of the dot is not a super clear representation of the number. I think these kinds of charts work better if there are bigger differences in the numbers and sizes. With the colors and the axes, it is difficult to focus on the regions because my eye is drawn to the colored generations. It is just a little overwhelming._

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I wouldn't use different colors for different generations. Maybe use a heatmap on a table or something else. I just don't think the dot size thing is working._

**User 2**

Can you tell me what you think this is?

_A plot of social media accounts for different regions and generations_

Can you describe what this is telling you?

_Not really.It is pretty confusing._

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_Assuming the number is the number of separate social media accounts a single person has, I think, some of these groups have way more accounts than I would have expected._

Is there anything you would change of do differently?

_I want it to tell me what its trying to say. Speak your truth chart. But in all seriousness, I think it just needs a different design. There's too much going on here for me to figure out what  you're trying to tell me._
