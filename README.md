# Data-Visualization-Portfolio

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio where I will be sharing charts, graphs, and other visualizations I create for my Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About Me

Hello! My name is Allison Michalowski, and I am a first year student in the MS in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology (MSHCA) at Carnegie Mellon University. I recently graduated from the University of Delaware, where I studied public health and psychology. My background is largely in health care and public health. As an undergraduate, I worked for the Institute for Public Administration at the University of Delaware where I created digital tools to help local governments implement health promoting policies. I also worked for former Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine, who is now serving as the United States Assistant Secretary of Health. In this position, I redeveloped an Pennsylvania Department of Health IRB, including guiding the implementation of a new online portal for IRB submissions. I also researched and wrote publications for diverse audiences on LGBT health care, rural health, and the opioid crisis. 

As a MSHCA student at CMU, I am building on my public health background by developing skills in health analytics, machine learning, and decision making. In addition to being a full time student, I continue to In addition to being a full-time student, I continue to work in research. Since graduating in 2020, I have worked as a researcher for Dr. Jane Liebschutz, Chief of the Department of General Internal Medicine at UPMC. Here my research focuses on preventing addiction, substance use treatment, and utilizing human centered design principles to reduce stigma around pain treatment and addiction. 

# What I Hope to Learn

I am taking telling stories with data to learn how to make clear, professional visualizations because visualizations are an essential part of helping people utilize data in decision making processes. It is important to make visualizations that are clear, representative of the data, and as unbiased as possible. At the same time, the visualization should also convey interesting trends and results found in the data. I hope that this class will teach me how to create honest representations of data that still bring emphasize the most important patterns and findings. When I graduate, I plan to work as a health data scientist, and I believe that these skills will be crucial to making the results of my models more meaningful to my company and coworkers.
