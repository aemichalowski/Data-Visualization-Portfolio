Welcome to the third and final part of my final project for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University. Throughout this project, I applied many of the skills I learned in class to a topic of great personal interest, telehealth in rural communities. My final product, ‘Strengthening Digital Infrastructure and Telehealth Capabilities for a Healthier Rural America’ blends concepts of design, storytelling, and data visualization to provide local public health officials and community advocate with resources to build capacity for telehealth in their communities. This final product is the result of an iterative process through which I drafted ideas, collected user feedback, and refined my work based on both feedback from users and my own ever-developing knowledge about design and data visualization.
