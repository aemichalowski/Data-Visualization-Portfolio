## Initial Wireframe

### Title: Strengthening Digital Infrastructure and Telehealth Capabilities for a Healthier Rural America

### I. Introduction
#### Get audience interested and prepare them for the rest of the story
- Briefly set up story (rural health, telehealth, barriers to telehealth, solution)
- Make audience clear: Why will this be helpful for public health officials and community advocates for rural areas
- Briefly introduce call to action: Address barriers to telehealth in rural areas to make telehealth a more viable solution for your community

### II. Health Disparities
#### Why does something need to be done about rural health? Why should I be worried about the health of my community?
- High Prevalence of poor health outcomes in rural areas

#### Why are there poor health outcomes in rural areas? What are the barriers to good health?
- Rural health infrastructure
  - Financial problems among hospitals [call out statistic about 130 rural hospital closures since 2010]
  - Geographic challenges (distance, time, transportation) [call out statistic about number of appointments missed each year due to lack of transportation]
  - Provider shortages

- High levels of risk factors for poor health
   - Low education, low health literacy, high unemployment, older age, low income, poor health behaviors

### III. Telehealth as a Solution to Rural Healthcare Access

#### Why is telehealth particularly suitable for rural areas?
- Address physician shortage by connecting patients to 
- Timely care
- Reduce transportation barriers
- Support continuity of care 
- Economic benefits for rural areas

### IV. Barriers to Telehealth in Rural Areas

#### How does the digital divide hinder the implementation of telehealth in rural areas?
- Low high-speed broadband access according to traditional metrics

- Even lower levels of high-speed broadband access when considering proposed metrics that align with modern internet use

- Lower access to personal devices (computers, tablets)
- Low digital health literacy

#### Rural providers have adopted telehealth more slowly. What factors contribute to provider hesitancy to adopt telehealth?

- Slower adoption by providers

- Provider concerns about maintaining telehealth services over time

### V. Addressing the Digital Divide 

#### How do current policies work to overcome the digital divide and build sustainable digital infrastructure in rural areas?

- Rural Digital Opportunity Fund: Expanding rural broadband infrastructure by funding contractors to build broadband networks in rural areas
- Emergency Broadband Benefit Program: Assistance paying for internet and personal devices for low-income families during COVID-19
- Local educational campaigns and programs: Improving digital health literacy

#### What more needs to be done?

- Many communities have yet to receive the benefits of these programs, and they are limited in time and scope, such that more will need to be done to improve digital infrastructure for all communities
- Communities may not know how to access these resources 
- Can help communities apply for appropriate grants and opportunities
- Can develop suitable educational campaigns and programs for the needs of the community in partnership with local stakeholders (library, medical facilities, tech workers)

### VI. Increasing Provider Adoption

#### How do current policies work to increase provider adoption of telehealth services in rural areas?

- Though telehealth regulation and legislation has been slow historically, a wave of temporary legislation during COVID-19 created many policies meant to provide structure to support telehealth:
    - HIPAA flexibility
    - New patients allowed over telehealth
    - Better billing for telehealth
    - Expanded Medicaid and Medicare coverage 
    - Allow for more treatments over telehealth
- Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants: Connecting local providers with resources to improve the uptake of telehealth (funding for equipment and system development)

#### What more needs to be done?
- Much of the legislation that provides structure to telehealth is set to expire after the COVID-19 pandemic, which will make it more difficult to maintain telehealth programs (support development of more permanent regulation) 
- Workforce needs trained to use new equipment effectively - workforce training programs
- Help local community health providers apply for grants to fund their transition to telehealth

### VII. Call to Action: As a public health official or community advocate, you can work to improve the viability of telehealth in your rural community

#### What can you do to support telehealth in your community?

- Assess the needs of your community
- Know the stakeholders - who do you have connections with/can connect with 
- Prioritize the needs of your community in regards to importance and level or resources required
- Assess the feasibility of each idea
- Choose the best strategy to start addressing your community's needs and get started
