# Facilitating Telehealth to Promote Rural Health Project: Storyboard, Wireframes, and User Research

## Storyboard

I created this storyboard to clarify how I anticipate the intended audience interacting with each of the key components of the story. By understanding these goals, I was able to better focus on the points I wanted to emphasize in my story as I built my wireframe. Additionally, this helped me get an idea of what I should look for in my user research. If these points aren't being made clear to the reviewers, I may need to revisit my story content and structure.

## Wireframe

For my wireframe, I included high fidelity versions of the major data visualizations I intend to include in my final project. To connect these data visualizations to the larger story, I included brief headers for each of the major parts of the story, questions the audience may have about that topic, and a combination of the data visualizations and brief text that is intended to answer those questions. I kept the text elements brief to focus on the overarching narrative and the role the visualizations play in that story, so that my user research could help me understand how well the visualizations are able to support my main points in the absense of detailed text.

### Title: Strengthening Digital Infrastructure and Telehealth Capabilities for a Healthier Rural America

### I. Introduction
#### Get audience interested and prepare them for the rest of the story
- Briefly set up story (rural health, telehealth, barriers to telehealth, solution)
- Make audience clear: Why will this be helpful for public health officials and community advocates for rural areas
- Briefly introduce call to action: Address barriers to telehealth in rural areas to make telehealth a more viable solution for your community

### II. Health Disparities
#### Why does something need to be done about rural health? Why should I be worried about the health of my community?
- High Prevalence of poor health outcomes in rural areas

#### Why are there poor health outcomes in rural areas? What are the barriers to good health?
- Rural health infrastructure
  - Financial problems among hospitals [call out statistic about 130 rural hospital closures since 2010]
  - Geographic challenges (distance, time, transportation) [call out statistic about number of appointments missed each year due to lack of transportation]
  - Provider shortages

- High levels of risk factors for poor health
   - Low education, low health literacy, high unemployment, older age, low income, poor health behaviors

### III. Telehealth as a Solution to Rural Healthcare Access

#### Why is telehealth particularly suitable for rural areas?
- Address physician shortage by connecting patients to providers outside the immediate area
- Timely care
- Reduce transportation barriers
- Support continuity of care 
- Economic benefits for rural areas

### IV. Barriers to Telehealth in Rural Areas

#### How does the digital divide hinder the implementation of telehealth in rural areas?
- Low high-speed broadband access according to traditional metrics

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93174933/143128906-ed098a65-a051-4bc9-bb2e-c38d1cba7952.png)

- Even lower levels of high-speed broadband access when considering proposed metrics that align with modern internet use

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93174933/143129707-472306c6-91e5-4657-b15a-e46943f32a76.png)


- Lower access to personal devices (computers, tablets)
- Low digital health literacy

#### Rural providers have adopted telehealth more slowly. What factors contribute to provider hesitancy to adopt telehealth?

- Slower adoption by providers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93174933/143130366-40dd0ba2-a89a-4b50-b52f-ed8df8482389.png)

- Provider concerns about maintaining telehealth services over time
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93174933/143133045-b66bd989-ef28-405a-80dc-df19c36219f4.png)

### V. Addressing the Digital Divide 

#### How do current policies work to overcome the digital divide and build sustainable digital infrastructure in rural areas?

- Rural Digital Opportunity Fund: Expanding rural broadband infrastructure by funding contractors to build broadband networks in rural areas
- Emergency Broadband Benefit Program: Assistance paying for internet and personal devices for low-income families during COVID-19
- Local educational campaigns and programs: Improving digital health literacy

#### What more needs to be done?

- Many communities have yet to receive the benefits of these programs, and they are limited in time and scope, such that more will need to be done to improve digital infrastructure for all communities
- Communities may not know how to access these resources 
- Can help communities apply for appropriate grants and opportunities
- Can develop suitable educational campaigns and programs for the needs of the community in partnership with local stakeholders (library, medical facilities, tech workers)

### VI. Increasing Provider Adoption

#### How do current policies work to increase provider adoption of telehealth services in rural areas?

- Though telehealth regulation and legislation has been slow historically, a wave of temporary legislation during COVID-19 created many policies meant to provide structure to support telehealth:
    - HIPAA flexibility
    - New patients allowed over telehealth
    - Better billing for telehealth
    - Expanded Medicaid and Medicare coverage 
    - Allow for more treatments over telehealth
- Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants: Connecting local providers with resources to improve the uptake of telehealth (funding for equipment and system development)

#### What more needs to be done?
- Much of the legislation that provides structure to telehealth is set to expire after the COVID-19 pandemic, which will make it more difficult to maintain telehealth programs (support development of more permanent regulation) 
- Workforce needs trained to use new equipment effectively - workforce training programs
- Help local community health providers apply for grants to fund their transition to telehealth

### VII. Call to Action: As a public health official or community advocate, you can work to improve the viability of telehealth in your rural community

#### What can you do to support telehealth in your community?

- Assess the needs of your community
- Know the stakeholders - who do you have connections with/can connect with 
- Prioritize the needs of your community in regards to importance and level or resources required
- Assess the feasibility of each idea
- Choose the best strategy to start addressing your community's needs and get started 

## User Research

### Research Methods

#### Participant Selection

The intended audience for my story is public health professionals and community advocates with ties to rural communities. Unfortunately, I was unable to test the preliminary wireframe with individuals that fit the description. Instead, I selected three individuals that had either a health or policy related background, as public health officials and community advocates tend to have an interest in both health and policy. Throughout the interviews, I asked the participants to imagine themselves as a local public health worker or community advocate and to reflect on the information from that perspective. Additionally, I selected participants with diverse interests and backgrounds to best understand how people may approach the information differently. Participant 1 had a background in mathematics and was well-versed in data analysis as well as health. Participant 2 works in a health-related setting and has a background that focuses more on art and design. Participant 3 compliments the health perspectives with a more general policy perspective, which is useful for understanding how this information could impact community advocates who may not focus specifically on health.

#### Protocol

To develop a relevant script, I first established what I wanted to learn from the interviews. Ultimately, I composed a list of the five things I was most interested in soliciting feedback on:

-	How clear are the intentions and meanings of the key parts of my story as detailed in the storyboard above?
-	How clear and understandable are the visualizations?
-	How well do the visualizations support the overarching story?
-	How well does the story flow and build to the ultimate call to action?
-	Are there any changes I could make that would make the story more meaningful and interesting to the reader?

With these priorities in mind, I developed a list of questions that addressed the readerâ€™s holistic perception of the story, each individual section, each visualization, and how well the visualizations and sections worked together. The questions are displayed in the interview results table below. To conduct the interviews, I recruited my participants and discussed my priorities for the interview, so that they had these key concepts in mind while reflecting on individual questions. I then asked the participants to read through the wireframe and think about it for a few minutes. Once they had an initial impression, I asked them my interview questions and recorded their responses. I allowed them to continue looking through the wireframe while answering the questions, so that they could directly identify the subjects of their critiques.

### User Interviews

|---|---|---|---|
|    <br> **General Questions**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_How would   you summarize this story in 1-2 sentences?_    |    <br>If we want to   improve healthcare for rural Americans, we need to make telehealth more accessible   by building broadband and increasing resources to help them use telehealth.    |    <br>Rural   Americans have poor health, and we need to support telehealth, so they can   have better access to healthcare.    |    <br>Telehealth   could help address many of the health disparities experienced by rural   populations. We can grow the use of telehealth among rural populations by   working to improve digital infrastructure and supporting providers.     |
|    <br>_Is there   anything you did not understand?_    |    <br>Not really    |    <br>No.    |    <br>No. It was   all pretty clear.    |
|    <br>_Is there   anything in particular that you really liked?_   |    <br>I like the   colors that were used. It was really easy to see the differences between   things. Also, you kept the colors consistent, which is helpful. It is a pet   peeve of mine when people donâ€™t do that.     |    <br>I liked that   there were a lot of visuals. You might want to put some pictures in as well.    |    <br>I liked the   policy aspect and how you showed the reader how they could advocate for large   scale policies or pursue more local level efforts.    |
|    <br> **Health Disparities**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Why do you   think the story includes information on health disparities?_    |    <br>To set up what   the problem is, poor health in rural communities, and explain what causes   that, transportation, economics, and lack of doctors.    |    <br>To give you   the motivation for the rest of the narrative.    |    <br>It establishes   the problem and the factors that contribute to the problem, so you can put   the intervention in context.    |
|    <br>_What does this   section make you think about?_     |    <br>Individuals in   rural areas and the struggles they face. Specifically it makes me think about   farmers and how they produce so much of the food and other things that help   keep us safe and healthy, but we arenâ€™t helping keep them healthy.    |    <br>I feel bad   for people living in rural areas. It is crazy how few health providers are   out there.     |    <br>It definitely   reminds me of the broader public health and public policy context. You are   looking at rural urban dynamics and there are many disparities that go beyond   health itself. It just reminds me of how many little things play a role in   health outcomes.    |
|    <br>_What do you think of the poor health outcomes visualization? How well does it fit in the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>The visualization   makes a lot of sense and it looks nice. It seems like a mix of different   topics though, so maybe they would work in separate plots.    |    <br>It looks nice,   but the scale for the bottom two is â€˜sooooâ€™ different from the top two, that   it kind of distorts the interpretation. You could split them in two.     |    <br>I would separate   these out. The scales arenâ€™t the same and they seem to address different types   of outcomes. Maybe you could find data on a few more health conditions and pair   that with diabetes.    |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the provider shortages visualization? How well does it fit in the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>Thereâ€™s a lot   more specialists in the urban areas. So few primary care in the rural areas.   And thatâ€™s, well thatâ€™s a big problem. The graph definitely makes an impact.    |    <br>This one is   really good. It gets the point across. I think I remembered it most of all   the things in this section.    |    <br>This one   really shows you the huge difference in the amount of providers. Itâ€™s a good   graphic.    |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the health risk factors visualization? How well does it fit in   the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>I like it. Is   there any way to make the font for the axes darker. The trend of rural having   higher risk is very clear.    |    <br>It makes   sense. Donâ€™t have any recommendations there.    |    <br>â€˜Obeseâ€™ and â€˜smokeâ€™   sound awkward. I get what you were trying to do with making the categories   sound similar, but it would still make more sense with just â€˜obesityâ€™ and â€˜smokingâ€™.    |
|    <br>_Would you change anything about this section?_    |    <br>I would move   the last plot above middle plot. It would make more sense in the narrative in   my opinion.    |    <br>Not really.    |    <br>Change the   order of the last two graphics, so the health risk factors are near the poor   health.    |
|    <br>**Telehealth as a Solution to Rural Healthcare Access**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Why do you   think the story includes a section on telehealth as a solution to rural   healthcare access?_   |    <br>In order to   like tell us a possible solution to help people be healthier and reasons why to   pick this solution.     |    <br>Why   telehealth is a good idea.    |    <br>How telehealth   overcomes the barriers in the previous section.    |
|    <br>_What does   the section make you think about?_    |    <br>Makes me   think of smart technology and how that could be integrated in rural areas.    |    <br>That telehealth   seems like a straightforward solution to health problems in rural areas.    |    <br>Telehealth   should play a bigger role in rural healthcare as we move forward.    |
|    <br>_Would you   change anything about this section?_    |    <br>No, that   looks pretty good. Its fine to me.    |    <br>Is there any   order of importance? If so you could include that.    |    <br>Maybe make an   infographic or something to make it a little more interesting. I donâ€™t know. Like   itâ€™s fine, but if you want to make it more fun, pictures or something would   help.    |
|    <br>**Barriers to Telehealth in Rural Areas**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Why do you   think the story includes a section on barriers to telehealth?_   |    <br>To make it   clear why rural people canâ€™t necessarily use telehealth right now.    |    <br>To show that   it isnâ€™t as easy as just saying we are going to use telehealth now. That isnâ€™t   really practical for some people.    |    <br>Explain from   an infrastructure and provider side why telehealth can be challenging to use   in rural areas.    |
|    <br>_What does   the section make you think about?_    |    <br>It makes me   think of how frustrating it can be even when you have pretty good internet   and your devices are working slow or struggling to connect. Especially like a   video call like telehealth stuff usually is.    |    <br>It makes me   sad that rural people canâ€™t access telehealth.    |    <br>This makes me   think that we need to put more focus on telehealth policies that specifically   account for challenges in rural communities.    |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the traditional metrics broadband visualization? How well does   it fit in the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>I like it. I   am a little confused about what the colors mean because it says 0-50, but   splits in the middle. Interesting take for the story though.    |    <br>The caption   was helpful. I donâ€™t know much about broadband, so at first, I was like, why   should I care? Then I read the caption, and it made sense even though I donâ€™t   know much about the topic.    |    <br>It is great   except for the legend. I definitely know what you are trying to show, but you   really need that middle 25 on the legend. Same for the next map.    |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the proposed metrics broadband visualization? How well does it   fit in the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>Yeah, I like this   one too, but same issue with the legend.     |    <br>Same as   before. Caption is super useful.    |    <br>This wouldnâ€™t   be in the map itself, but could you also do a call out with how many counties   flipped. I just think that would be really interesting.    |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the slow adoption by providers visualization? How well does it   fit in the section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>Was   confused by the title. <br>   <br>Recommended   title change to â€˜Urban Providers have been using Telehealth for longer than   Rural Providersâ€™    |    <br>Itâ€™s fine. The   colors are kind of weird and donâ€™t fully fit with the rest of the sections.    |    <br>I honestly   donâ€™t have much of an opinion on this one. I understand it, and the data   makes sense.     |
|    <br>_What do   you think of the provider concerns visualization? How well does it fit in the   section? Would you change anything?_    |    <br>Maybe cut a   few of the categories that arenâ€™t of interest or something. There are a lot   of things to look at here. For example, the ones like technical support that   are close together for rural and urban could be taken out. But Iâ€™m not sure   maybe thatâ€™s important.     |    <br>This looks   really neat. Is there a way to show the average percent too? If not, thatâ€™s   fine. I just think it would be neat.    |    <br>Can you space   it out or make it a little bigger. It looks cool, but its kind of small which   makes it harder to read. Other than that, I really like this one.    |
|    <br>_Would you   change anything about this section?_    |    <br>Not a change   really, but when you turn it into the final product, make sure to have clear   subsections because thereâ€™s a lot of info here.    |    <br>Nothing other   than what I already said.    |    <br>No.    |
|    <br>**Addressing the Digital Divide**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Why do you   think the story includes a section on addressing the digital divide?_    |    <br>To outline   steps that help overcome the digital divide and show strategies that really   work.    |    <br>Tell you what   some people have done to try to solve this problem.    |    <br>To introduce   the reader to ongoing policies that address the digital divide and show the   reader what still needs to be improved.    |
|    <br>_What does   the section make you think about?_    |    <br>It makes me   think we are capable of doing something about these problems.    |    <br>Big policies   and how expensive it is to work on this.    |    <br>I worry that   many communities donâ€™t know about these policies and donâ€™t get the chance to   take advantage of them.    |
|    <br>_Would you   change anything about this section?_    |    <br>For thinking   about what needs to be done â€“ you could sort of split this into two subpoints.   Limitations and next steps/future directions or something.    |    <br>No.    |    <br>No.    |
|    <br>**Increasing Provider Adoption**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Why do you   think the story includes a section on increasing provider adoption?_    |    <br>Steps to   improve adoption of telehealth practices among healthcare providers.    |    <br>Explain how   to make it more practical for providers to incorporate telehealth.    |    <br>To introduce   the reader to programs and policies that help providers more sustainably   implement telehealth.    |
|    <br>_What does   the section make you think about?_    |    <br>It is frustrating   to see how long it took them to put regulations in place and then learn a lot   of them are going to expire.    |    <br>I work in   health insurance customer service, and this reminds me of a lot of the   changes that have been happening during COVID, and we still donâ€™t really know   what is going to happen after all this.    |    <br>These   definitely feel like things a community advocate could get involved in.    |
|    <br>_Would you   change anything about this section?_    |    <br>Same as the   previous. Limitations of current policies and future directions instead of   mixing them together.    |    <br>No, I really   like this one.    |    <br>No.    |
|    <br>**Call to Action**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Did the   call to action seem appropriate for the audience?_    |    <br>Yes.     |    <br>Yep.    |    <br>Yes.    |
|    <br>_Did the   call to action make sense in the context of the rest of the story? If so, how   well did the story build up to the call of action?_    |    <br>Yeah, it made   sense. The story did well in laying out the problem and how we are planning   to address the problems, which leads right up to what I can do. Now I could   do a bit more research and then go out and make things happen in my   theoretical community.     |    <br>Yep. It   totally makes sense. You explain why there is a problem and what you can do   about it. Then at the end, you make me feel empowered to actually carry it   out.    |    <br>For sure.   Right away, you made it clear we were going to find solutions for our   community in the intro. Then you gave a clear problem statement and potential   solutions. Once you have the potential solutions, the logical next step is to   figure out how to use them, which is what you help with in the call to   action.    |
|    <br>_Would you   change anything about this section?_    |    <br>It has been a   while since you had a visualization. Could you use an infographic or something?       |    <br>I would include   some regular pictures. Just to keep peopleâ€™s attention.    |    <br>No.    |
|    <br>**Wrap-Up**    |  |  |  |
|    <br>_Overall,   how well did the visualizations fit in with the story? Did they make the   story more impactful?_    |    <br>They did make   it more impactful. I really like the consistent color scheme. It makes me   happy.    |    <br>I liked them.   They were pretty and made sense. I liked that the titles actually explained   what it was showing instead of just being â€˜this vs thatâ€™.    |    <br>The   visualizations were really good. They emphasized your key points and were   easy to understand.    |
|    <br>_Are there   any other data you would recommend presenting or any visualizations you would   add?_    |    <br>That last   infographic like I said.     |    <br>Not that I   can think of. Just pictures like I said.    |    <br>Some of the   sections that are more policy based than data based could use something visual   to help hold your attention. I really like infographics, personally. Like the   kind that call out interesting facts. But you could also use pictures or something.       |
|    <br>_Is there   anything else you would recommend changing?_     |    <br>Could you   link to the policies, so the reader could learn more without having to go through   too much effort.    |    <br>Nope.    |    <br>Not that I   can think of.    |
|    <br>_Any last   comments?_    |    <br>No.    |    <br>Nope. That   was pretty neat.     |    <br>Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve   got.    |


## Reflections on User Interviews

### Alignment Between Interviews

Overall, the feedback from each user aligned with the feedback from other participants. In particular, positive sentiments were generally shared among respondents. Additionally, for several of the visualizations, there were shared or similar criticisms. These common themes are further explored in the two sections below. One interesting critique stood apart from the others as it was only held by one user, but that user felt very passionate about it. User 1 was very confused by the title for the stacked bar chart of length of telehealth use among rural and urban providers. The original title was â€˜Rural Providers Have Started Using Telehealth in Their Practices More Recently than Urban Providersâ€™. The user was very confused by the title and said it distracted from the data. Specifically, he thought the words â€˜more recentlyâ€™ did not make sense. I discussed this with him and tried to understand the source of the confusion. Working together, we developed a new title for the visualization: â€˜Urban Providers have been using Telehealth for longer than Rural Providersâ€™.

### Positive Feedback

-	The users appreciated the color scheme and thought it was suitable for the data
-	The users understood the main point of each section and were able to identify the reason each part was included
-	The users found the visualizations impactful and thought they fit with the context of the broader narrative
-	The users thought the call to action was clear and believed the story built up to the call to action in a logical way
-	The users indicated that the story would make sense to the audience of interest and that the call to action was appropriate for that audience
-	The users cited emotional impacts from some of the data visualizations and felt empathy for the challenges faced by rural communities


### Implementing Constructive Criticism

My user research interviews helped me identify unclear, confusing, and awkward aspects of my proposed story structure. Reflecting on these criticisms, I planned a series of changes that will help me improve the flow and impact for the final version of my story.
