## Visualizing OECD Data with Flourish
<br />
Flourish is a free, web-based data visualization tool with many pre-built templates that work to steer users toward implementing good design principles. Each of the visualizations below was made using Flourish and the OECD government debt data.
<br />
### Grid of Line Charts
<br />
The grid of line charts below displays time series data of the debt-to-GDP ratio for each country included in the OECD data. The visualization consists of several subplots, each of which represents a unique country. Separating each country allows the viewer to more easily see trends for distinct countries, while the shared axes allow for these trends to be compared between countries.

### Line Chart with Highlight
<br />
Line charts are a classic method of displaying time series data as the lines. However, when there are many categories included in one plot, the line chart can become cluttered. As such, it is helpful to highlight specific data of interest. In this chart, I highlight the average debt-to-gdp ratio over time for all reported countries.

<br />
### Connected Dot Plot
<br />
Whereas the plots above visualized the full dataset, this dot plot focuses on a subset of the data. This plot worked to convey the change in Debt-to-GDP ratio for individual countries between 2010 and 2019.

<br />
### Slope Chart
<br />
Like the dot plot above, the slope chart shows provides information for a subset of the data. While the plot looks similar to a line chart, the slope chart shows more general trends by only including data from certain years and connecting those years with slopes that represent the average total change in debt-to-GDP ratio in that time. The slope chart below shows the change in debt-to-GDP ratio over five year intervals and highlights the OECD average.
